This repository contains all scripts used to analysis the model output and produce the figures.

* Functions and definitions used in all scripts: Info_definitions.py

* Python scripts to create all figures: Fig*.ipynb

* Code to calculate surface water mass transformation:
  * run_SWMT_calculation.sh which calls SWMT_calculation.sh and SWMT_calculation.py
  * run_SWMT_calculation_sensitivity_fluxes_rho.sh which calls SWMT_calculation_sensitivity_fluxes_rho.sh and SWMT_calculation_sensitivity_fluxes_rho.py
 
* Databases to index model output of all experiments: *.db
